# Regression-problems-using-Neural-Network-with-Custom-Loss-Function

This is an attempt to solve a regression problem using Neural Networks. Vanilla loss function penalizes errors on either side of the actuals equally but in certain case studies it might be required to penalize losses differently. For example, early delivery and breach in delivery in case of e-commerce  certainly have different impact on customer experience.
